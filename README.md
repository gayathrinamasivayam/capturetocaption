# Caption as a Service

### The aim of this project is to provide captions for products from their images. Online marketplaces are rapidly growing at a fast pace and the goal of this product is to provide instant image captioning system that can take an image of a furniture and produce an instant caption. The product is currently setup to work with sofas and chairs.

### The captioning system uses an encoder decoder architecture. It is based on the prior work done in the field of image captioning. The project was built on Keras with a Tensorflow backend.

In the future I plan to use an attention architecture and vary it to see if I can improve the results obtained so far, as well as reduce the inference time of generating a caption from its image.  

### The code and the documentation are being updated on this repository
