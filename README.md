# Caption as a Service

### The aim of this project is to provide captions for products from their images. Online marketplaces are rapidly growing at a fast pace and the goal of this product is to provide instant image captioning system that can take an image of a product and produce an instant caption. We have currently trained the system using images of sofas and their captions from webscraped data.
